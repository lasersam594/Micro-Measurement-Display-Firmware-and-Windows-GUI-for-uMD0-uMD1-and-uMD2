Micro Measurement Display (µMD) is a Windows GUI for use with uMD0, uMD1, and uMD2 (which may be found in separate repositories).  It provides real time display of data from homodyne and heterodyne interferometers
with most of the functions of a commercial system like the HP-5508A and more.  A PC with a USB port running Windows XP or later and .NET 4.0 or later is required for the custom µMD application.  Almost any Windows
PC more recent than the Jurassic period should be satisfactory. :-)  So dust off that old laptop and put it to good use! Sorry, µMD does not run on a phone - yet!  (However, data may be streamed in real-time
wirelessly to an Android device using additional hardware and firmware, NOT INCLUDED.)  The Graphical User Interface (µMD GUI) provides real-time displacement and velocity measurements using the included interferometer
optics, as well as optional frequency analysis of the displacement data.  µMD also supports straightness and angle measurements with appropriate optics and allows for their parameters to be entered if not standard.
Environmental compensation parameters (temperature, pressure, humidity) may be entered manually.  Up to three measurement axes are supported.

For more information, please see the links in the uMD0, uMD1, or uMD2 repositories.  For general information on the uMD GUI they are all similar; for more on a specific application, select the most apprpriate.
