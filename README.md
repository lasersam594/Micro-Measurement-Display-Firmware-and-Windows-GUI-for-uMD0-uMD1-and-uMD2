Micro Measurement Display (µMD) is a Windows GUI for use with µMD0, µMD1, and µMD2 (located in separate repositories) which provides real time display of data from homodyne interferometers, encoders, and other devices
providing Quadrature output; and heterodyne interferometers using two frequency HeNe lasers.  It supports most of the functions of a commercial display like the HP-5508A and more.  A PC with a USB port running Windows XP
or later and .NET 4.0 or later is required for the custom µMD application.  Almost any Windows PC more recent than the Jurassic period should be satisfactory. :-)  So dust off that old laptop and put it to good use! Sorry,
µMD does not run on a phone - yet!  (However, data may be streamed in real-time wirelessly to an Android device using additional hardware and firmware, NOT INCLUDED.)  The Graphical User Interface (µMD GUI) provides
real-time displacement and velocity measurements using a variety of standard and custom interferometer optics, as well as optional frequency analysis of the data.  µMD also supports straightness and angle measurements with
appropriate optics and allows for their parameters to be entered if not standard.  Environmental compensation parameters (temperature, pressure, humidity) may be entered manually.  Up to three measurement axes are supported.

While the source code (written in Microsoft Visual Basic) for µMD is neither open source or in the public domain, it may be provided upon request for serious applications.  But we will not be expected to provide
enhancements or even minor bug fixes, in part because I (for one) have no clue how it works at this point as my brain was backed up quite a while ago and I've lost the passwords. ;( ;-)

For general information on the µMD GUI, please see the links in the µMD0, µMD1, or µMD2 repositories.  (They are all similar.)  For specifics, select the one most apprpriate for your application.
